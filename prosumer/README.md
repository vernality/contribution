My colleague regularly posts super relevant and useful information in our work chat. Mostly they are reposts from Twitter. 
I see that he is up to date with the most relevant and useful information in our profession. He is also great as a professional.
I would be super happy to know which sources of information are the best in his list.

A friend of mine is going to do some IT business locally. 
He knows I'm familiar with local community and he is eager to get the sources of relevant content and communication channels for his business.
I would like to share this information with him, but I don't have convenient tools to do it quickly and easily.

<details><summary markdown="span">After 10 years in profession I want to share my town thoughts on it</summary>
Being involved into programming for 10 years, I want to share my thoughts and validate if they are valuable for the community. 
I know there are tons of services, but I don't want to spend my time SMMing and monitoring my posts. 
I want a helper tool to distribute my thoughts over the internet and relevant up-to-date information flow in one place.
