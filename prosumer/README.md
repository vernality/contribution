## Concept
 
Being surrounded with tons of useless information sources, I have started valuing relevant and related to my life content, 
trying to avoid spending time and money on informational noise. 

Self-development and social recognition are two values relevant for me. To satisfy my goals, I want to limit incoming information. 
Also, I want to produce valuable content and become recognized among my professional community. 

I'm biased to mobile apps, that's why I would like to have an app that allows me to manage my subscriptions on Youtube, Twitter, Telegram, Instagram and so on. 
Also, I would like to be able to share my subscriptions and channels with my friends, if they are interested in my content playlists. 
I would love to have an SMM helper app to assist me in posting my own thoughts. 

My needs can be satisfied with an app called "Prosumer". It's a simple app with "In" and "Out" feeds, making me a reactor fueled with relevant information and producing (hopefully) valuable content for the community. 

Initially app allows me to manually manage my channels and subscriptions, giving me the opportunity to overview my informational flow. This can be done on "In" tab of the app, where I can add different kinds of subscriptions and channels.
My dream is to get rid of most of the useless subscriptions and channels eventually. 

The "Out" tab of the app allows me to conveniently post to social networks simple posts. 

And the "Profile" tab asks me to connect my social networks so that the app is able to do it's job.
