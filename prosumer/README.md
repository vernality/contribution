## Founder's request

<details><summary markdown="span">I want to know top and relevant Twitter users to follow in my profession.</summary>
My colleague regularly posts super relevant and useful information in our work chat. Mostly they are reposts from Twitter. 
I see that he is up to date with the most relevant and useful information in our profession. He is also great as a professional.

A friend of mine is going to do some IT business locally and wants to get my list of Telegram channels. 
He knows I'm familiar with local community and he is eager to get the sources of relevant content and communication channels for his business.

After 10 years in profession I want to share my town thoughts on it
Being involved into programming for 10 years, I want to share my thoughts and validate if they are valuable for the community.
